description: 'The best marketing resource any business can have is its workforce. A Reed survey found that 58% of employees grumble about their benefits package, but at the same time a benefits package was cited as the third-most important factor for jobseekers at 30% (behind brand image and reputation, which scored 37%, and salary at 33%).'
