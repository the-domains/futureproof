**"When I was young I thought that money was the most important thing in life.****Now that I am old, I know that it is." **

Oscar Wilde

Life is a journey, but without money, you're going nowhere. And fast.

The 20th century created a spirit of aspiration and acquisition that drove development across the decades, through science, technology, philosophy and war. It seemed so easy -- all you had to do was reach out and grab it.

So much innovation led us to believe we were going to have it easy. Then we discovered there was indeed a catch. It turned out the golden age of saving and financial security we believed was our birthright had been bought on tick and it was up to us to settle the bill.

I've been navigating the minefield that is money and financial services for more than a decade and if you'd like to walk the road with me, you'll be very welcome.
